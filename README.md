# Go Pizza

[Oh My Pizza!](https://www.ohmy.pizza/)

Go Pizza will lookup pizza deals in your local area.
It utilises the Papajohns, Dominos & Pizzahut API to lookup all deals at once, and display them in a single dashboard for conveinence.
Deals are ranked by fitness function, that can be found in ranking package.
Deal ranking isn't fully finished and still has some quirks.

## Fwiw

This was my first Go project, and I wrote this whilst in my final year of University.
I have made some minor changes to it since then, but mostly just light refactoring.

This is deployed to AWS as a lambda function.
CI to deploy to AWS is a current WIP.
