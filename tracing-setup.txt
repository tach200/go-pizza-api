For now I will move the jaegar tracer out of the aws lambda function.
This is simply so we can move this into prod version quicker, I will look into re-adding this once we have a first version in production and
experience any issues. Or just when I have time and motivation.

// Tracing setup for Jaegar
cfg := &config.Configuration{
		ServiceName: "go-pizza",
		// not sure what this is.
		Sampler: &config.SamplerConfig{
			Type:  "const",
			Param: 1,
		},
		// log the spans to output.
		Reporter: &config.ReporterConfig{
			LogSpans:           true,
			LocalAgentHostPort: "localhost:6831",
		},
	}

	tracer, closer, err := cfg.NewTracer(config.Logger(jaeger.StdLogger))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("err: cannot init jaeger: %v\n", err)
	}
	defer closer.Close()
	opentracing.SetGlobalTracer(tracer)

The tracer will need to be passed into getDeals() so that each of the services can be traced.
